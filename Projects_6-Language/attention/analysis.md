## Layer 1, Head 4

**Observation**: Head 4 from Layer 1 appears to pay attention to up to four preceding tokens, although sometimes it only focuses on the first token. It seems to be deriving the context of a token based on the tokens that precede it.

**Examples**:
1. In the phrase "We turned down a narrow lane and passed through a small [MASK]." 
   - When the token is "lane", it focuses on "turned down a narrow".
   - When the token is "[MASK]", it focuses on "passed through a small".

2. In the phrase "Then I picked up a [MASK] from the table."
   - When the token is "up", it focuses on "I picked".
   - When the token is "[MASK]", it focuses on "I picked up a [MASK]".
   - When the token is "table", it focuses on "from the".

3. In the phrase "The turtle moved slowly across the [MASK]."
   - The tokens from "moved" to "[MASK]" look at the 2-4 tokens that precede them.
   - The token "[MASK]" specifically looks at "moved slowly across the".

   - The token "trip" focuses on "made", despite the intervening tokens "a very long".
   - The token "country" focuses on "around", indicating it grasps the comprehensive nature of the trip.

2. In the phrase "This situation is far too much for any single [MASK] to bear alone."
   - The tokens "far", "much", and "for" focus on "too", recognizing the intensity.
   - The token "single" focuses on both "any" and "[MASK]", indicating it modifies the noun "[MASK]".
   - The token "[MASK]" focuses on "any single".
