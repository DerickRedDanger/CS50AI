Example Project Summary
Project Title: Tic-Tac-Toe AI

Objective: Create an AI that can play Tic-Tac-Toe and never lose.

Technologies and Tools:

Python
Minimax Algorithm
Description:
This project involved developing an AI that plays Tic-Tac-Toe. The AI uses the minimax algorithm to determine the best possible move at any given time. The game interface allows a human player to play against the AI.

What I Learned:

Implementing the minimax algorithm to solve a game problem.
Understanding game trees and how to evaluate game states.
Enhancing problem-solving skills by debugging and optimizing the AI.
Code Snippets/Examples:

python
Copy code
def minimax(board, depth, is_maximizing):
    if is_winner(board, PLAYER_X):
        return 1
    elif is_winner(board, PLAYER_O):
        return -1
    elif is_tie(board):
        return 0

    if is_maximizing:
        best_score = -float('inf')
        for move in get_possible_moves(board):
            board[move] = PLAYER_X
            score = minimax(board, depth + 1, False)
            board[move] = EMPTY
            best_score = max(score, best_score)
        return best_score
    else:
        best_score = float('inf')
        for move in get_possible_moves(board):
            board[move] = PLAYER_O
            score = minimax(board, depth + 1, True)
            board[move] = EMPTY
            best_score = min(score, best_score)
        return best_score
Describing Course Learnings
When summarizing what you learned from the course lectures, focus on key takeaways and how they helped you in your projects:

Search Algorithms: Learned about depth-first search, breadth-first search, and A* search, which were applied in solving maze and pathfinding problems.
Knowledge Representation: Gained an understanding of how to represent knowledge in a way that an AI can process, which was useful in building logic-based AI.
Machine Learning: Studied the basics of machine learning, including supervised and unsupervised learning, which helped in developing simple predictive models.
Neural Networks: Learned the fundamentals of neural networks and how to implement them using TensorFlow, which was crucial for projects involving image recognition or other complex tasks.
